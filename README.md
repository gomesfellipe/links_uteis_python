# Links úteis Python <img src="https://analizare.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/links-uteis.png" align="right" height="139" />

Este repositório esta em constante construção! 

## Por que um repositório de links?

Todo dia muito conteúdo sobre estatística, machine learning, programação em Python e tantos outros assuntos que interessam a quem estuda Ciência de Dados é gerado e nem sempre é possível acompanhar tanto conteúdo!

A medida que vamos caminhando profissionalmente utilizamos cada vez mais recursos e por isso resolvi criar esta lista de links exclusivamente para Python que me ajudaram ou poderiam vir a me ajudar no futuro

## Conteúdo

Existem links tanto em portugues quanto em inglês e todos os links aqui estão em linguagem Python. A organização destes links foi sendo feita conforme os links foram adicionados então ainda tem muito a melhorar! O importante é que o conteúdo está ai e basta um `ctrl+F` para achar algum material sobre o assunto de interesse
